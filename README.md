To make a delicious Brazo de Reina, a traditional Chilean rolled cake filled with dulce de leche, follow this recipe. This dessert is known for its light sponge cake and rich caramel filling, often topped with coconut.
Ingredients
For the Cake:
5 large eggs, at room temperature
¾ cup caster sugar (or granulated sugar blended to a fine powder)
1 cup cake flour, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon salt
For the Filling:
1 ½ cups dulce de leche (manjar)
Optional: shredded coconut for topping
Instructions
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a jelly roll pan (or a shallow baking sheet) with parchment paper and lightly grease it.
Prepare the Batter:
In a large bowl, separate the egg yolks and whites. In a bowl with the yolks, add half of the sugar and beat until the mixture is pale and creamy. Stir in the vanilla extract.
In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.
Gently fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sift the flour over the mixture and fold gently until just combined.
Bake the Cake:
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the center springs back when touched.
Once baked, remove from the oven and immediately turn the cake out onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with powdered sugar. Peel off the parchment paper.
Roll the Cake:
While the cake is still warm, roll it up tightly with the towel, starting from one short end. Let it cool completely in this rolled shape.
Fill the Cake:
Once cooled, carefully unroll the cake. Spread the dulce de leche evenly over the surface, leaving a small border around the edges.
Roll the cake back up without the towel, ensuring it’s tight but not too tight to avoid tearing.
Decorate:
Place the rolled cake seam-side down on a serving platter. Spread additional dulce de leche over the top and sprinkle with shredded coconut if desired.
Chill and Serve:
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set. Slice and serve chilled or at room temperature.
Notes
This cake is often enjoyed during afternoon tea or special occasions in Chile. Variations may include different fillings like fruit jams or chocolate cream.
Enjoy your homemade Brazo de Reina, a delightful treat that showcases the rich flavors of Chilean cuisine!

Here's a simple and delicious recipe for Cheese Empanadas that you can easily make at home. This recipe features a flaky dough filled with cheese, perfect for frying or baking.
Ingredients
For the Dough:
3 cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
1 large egg
½ cup ice-cold water
For the Filling:
1 lb shredded cheese (such as Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack)
1 large egg (for egg wash)
For Frying:
Vegetable oil (enough for deep frying)
Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
In a food processor, pulse together the flour and salt until combined.
Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal (about 15 pulses).
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and ice-cold water. Pour this mixture into the food processor and pulse until the dough starts to clump together but is still crumbly.
Chill the Dough:
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball. Divide the ball in half and flatten each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Roll Out the Dough:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) if baking. Roll out one disk of dough to about ⅛ inch thickness on a floured surface. Cut into circles about 5 inches in diameter.
Fill the Empanadas:
Place about 2 tablespoons of shredded cheese in the center of each circle. Dampen the edges of the dough with water using your finger or a brush. Fold the dough over to create a half-moon shape and press the edges firmly to seal. You can crimp the edges with a fork for a decorative touch.
Cooking Options:
To Fry: Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the empanadas in batches for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.
To Bake: Place the filled empanadas on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Whisk the remaining egg with a tablespoon of water and brush the tops of the empanadas. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve:
Enjoy the empanadas warm, either plain or with your favorite dipping sauce.
Tips
You can mix different types of cheese for varied flavors.
For a sweeter twist, sprinkle some sugar on top before baking, a common practice in some Latin American countries.
This recipe yields about 12 empanadas and is perfect for appetizers or snacks! Enjoy your homemade cheese empanadas!

## Torta de Milhojas

## ![](https://www.chileanfoodrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Recipe-for-Chilean-Homemade-Brazo-de-Reina.jpg)

To prepare a traditional Torta Milhojas (Thousand Layers Cake), a beloved Chilean dessert, follow this detailed recipe. This cake features layers of crispy dough filled with rich dulce de leche and often includes walnuts for added texture.
Ingredients
For the Dough:
3 cups sifted flour
250 grams (8 oz) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 egg yolks, at room temperature
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon rum or pisco
1 pinch of salt
For the Filling:
3 cups dulce de leche (or caramel)
2 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1/4 cup powdered sugar
Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the butter in chunks, egg yolks, milk, and rum or pisco. Mix using a fork or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment until a medium consistency dough forms. Avoid using your hands to prevent the butter from melting.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
Roll Out the Dough:
Divide the chilled dough into 14 equal portions. Roll each piece on a floured surface until very thin (about 1/8 inch thick). Use a plate to cut circles approximately 8-9 inches in diameter.
Pierce each circle with a fork to prevent puffing during baking.
Bake the Dough:
Place the circles on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until golden. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
Assemble the Cake:
Take one baked circle and spread 3-4 tablespoons of dulce de leche on top. Sprinkle some chopped walnuts over the dulce de leche.
Repeat layering with the remaining circles, alternating between layers of dulce de leche and walnuts. Typically, you can add walnuts every three layers.
Once all layers are stacked, cover the entire cake with a thin layer of dulce de leche.
Decorate:
For decoration, mix the remaining walnuts with powdered sugar and sprinkle it on top of the cake.
Chill and Serve:
Cover the cake and let it rest in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld. Serve at room temperature.
Notes
This cake is often enjoyed during special occasions in Chile, such as birthdays and national celebrations. The combination of crispy layers and sweet filling makes it a favorite among many.
Enjoy your homemade Torta Milhojas, a delightful representation of Chilean culinary tradition!
